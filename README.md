# Saudi-Arabia-hospital-admissions-analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze hospital admission data and support **data-driven decision-making** in healthcare operations. The dashboard focuses on understanding admission trends, emergency workload, patient demographics, disease severity, and readmission behavior.

The project covers the **full data analysis lifecycle**, starting from raw data cleaning to KPI definition and business insights generation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze hospital admission patterns over time.
* Identify peak emergency hours and seasonal trends.
* Monitor disease severity and high-risk patient groups.
* Compare performance across cities and hospitals.
* Support hospital managers in **resource allocation and staff planning**.

---

## 📊 Key KPIs

* Total Admissions
* Emergency Admissions Percentage
* Readmission Rate
* Average Length of Stay
* Admissions by Disease Severity
* Admissions by Age Group

---

## 🧠 Insights Generated

* Emergency admissions peak during specific hours and seasons.
* Certain diseases show consistently high severity levels.
* Readmission rates vary significantly by age group.
* Clear seasonal patterns affect hospital workload.
* Major differences exist between cities in admission volume.
